# ML/DS Interview Guide
This repo is a guide to prepare for ML/Data Science interviews

## Statistics
* Central Limit Theorem
* Bayes' theorem
## Linear Algebra
This section is needed the most for positions related to NLP and Recommender engines.
* Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
* Kernel, Range, Nullity, Rank
* Singular Value Decomposition
* Matrix Factorization
To learn about this topic check [Linear Algebra by Cherney et. al.](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~linear/linear-guest.pdf) or [khan academy website](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra).
## Data Preparation
### Feature Engineering
* typical groupby-agg,
* counting,
* [categorical encoding](https://towardsdatascience.com/smarter-ways-to-encode-categorical-data-for-machine-learning-part-1-of-3-6dca2f71b159] (Ordinal, OneHot, Binary, BaseN, Hashing),
* count vector,
* FM/FFM,
* NN and
* out of fold model
### Feature Selection
* Filter Methods
* Wrapper Methods
The search process may be methodical such as a best-first search, it may stochastic such as a random hill-climbing algorithm, or it may use heuristics, like forward and backward passes to add and remove features.
## Algorithms
### Classification
### Clustering
#### Hard Clustering
* K-means Clustering
* Hierarchical Clustering
#### Soft Clustering
* C-means Clustering
* GMM
### Regression

## Model Evaluation, Model Selection
Most of this section is taken from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12808.pdf)
